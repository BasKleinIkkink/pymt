## Merkletools
Most of the code in this repository was copies and/or edited from [pymerkletools](https://github.com/Tierion/pymerkletools).
This repository contains code needed to create merkle tries and merkle proofs.

### Installation
The biggest chance for a stable library is using one of the releases on the releases branch. If there are no releases or none that fit you, try the nightly rleases or build your own wheel file. Watch out when using nightly releases, this branch is used for adding experimental functions and may not work as expected
